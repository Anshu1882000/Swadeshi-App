'The Make in India initiative was launched by Prime Minister in September 2014 as part of a wider set of nation-building initiatives. Devised to transform India'
' into a global design and manufacturing hub, Make in India was a timely response to a critical situation. By 2013, the much-hyped emerging markets bubble had '
'burst, and India’s growth rate had fallen to its lowest level in a decade. The promise of the BRICS Nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) had '
'faded, and India was tagged as one of the so-called ‘Fragile Five’. Global investors debated whether the world’s largest democracy was a risk or an opportunity'
'India’s 1.2 billion citizens questioned whether India was too big to succeed or too big to fail. India was on the brink of severe economic failure, desperately in'
'need of a big push',

    'Atmanirbhar Bharat is the vision of the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi of making India a self-reliant nation. The first mention of this came in the '
        'form of the \'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan\' or \'Self-Reliant India Mission\' during the announcement of the coronavirus pandemic related economic '
        'package on 12 May 2020. This self-reliant policy does not aim to be protectionist in nature and as the Finance Minister clarified, "self-reliant India '
        'does not mean cutting off from rest of the world". The law and IT minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said that self-reliance does "not mean isolating away '
        'from the world. Foreign direct investment is welcome, technology is welcome self-reliant India... translates to being a bigger and more important part '
        'of the global economy.'
